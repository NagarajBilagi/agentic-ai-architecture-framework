# 🧠 Agentic AI Architecture Playground

This repository contains hands-on experiments exploring **Agentic AI architecture**, multi-agent systems, MCP tool integration, and debugging workflows using LangGraph orchestration framework and LangSmith observability platform.

> It is a structured exploration project to understand how modern AI agent systems work internally.

## 🚀 What This Project Covers

### 1️⃣ Basic Chatbot
- Built a simple LLM-powered chatbot  
- Explored prompt handling and conversation flow  
- Implemented basic interaction logic  

📁 `1_basic_chatbot/basic_chatbot.ipynb`

---

### 2️⃣ Human-in-the-Loop
- Added human intervention into agent workflows  
- Designed pause-and-resume execution logic  
- Explored supervised interaction patterns  

📁 `2_Human_assistance/human_in_loop.ipynb`

---

### 3️⃣ Debugging Agentic Systems
- Built agent logic in `agent.py`  
- Explored debugging techniques for agent workflows  
- Used LangGraph state checkpoints  
- Analyzed execution flow and failure handling  

📁 `3_debugging/`

---

### 4️⃣ Multi-Agent System
- Designed a supervised multi-agent architecture  
- Managed communication between agents  
- Structured task delegation logic  

📁 `4_Agents/multiAIAgent.ipynb`
